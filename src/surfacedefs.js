// Where each aircraft's flaps and speed brakes are on its model (cut out by surfaces.js).
// Model space: x to the right wing, y up, the nose toward −z, the model centred on its bounding box; every
// number is a fraction of the aircraft's length (so 0.05 on a 19.4 m F-15 is 0.97 m). Read positions off
// the grid in tools/aircraft/preview.js blueprint().
//
// A surface describes the right-hand (+x) one; it is mirrored for the left unless mirror: false.
//   top: [[x, z], ...]  convex outline seen from above, with y: [lo, hi] the height band it takes
//   side: [[z, y], ...] convex outline seen from the side, with x: [lo, hi] the band across
//   hinge: [[x, y, z], [x, y, z]]  the hinge line
//   angle: degrees at full travel. About a hinge running along x: positive takes the part aft of the hinge
//          down (flaps), negative raises it (spoilers, a dorsal brake). Along y: positive swings the aft part
//          outboard.
//   slide: [x, y, z]  translation at full travel (Fowler flaps run aft as they go down)
//   skin: 0 (default) cut through the whole thickness, walls close the cut (flaps); +1 / −1 a panel of the
//         upper / lower skin (outer / inner for a side outline), a floor `depth` below closes the bay
//   depth: bay depth for a skin panel (default 0.004)
// travel: { flap, brake } seconds for full travel, when it differs from the category default (surfaces.js)
// Flap notches: the game has two (takeoff, landing); a surface's angle is its landing (full) deflection and
// the takeoff notch is half of it. How to measure and check a new aircraft: tools/aircraft/SURFACES.md.
